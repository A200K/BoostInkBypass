# Boost.ink Bypass Script
Recently i wanted to download a file someone posted on youtube when i stumbled across a site called Boost.ink<br>
<a href="https://boost.ink/">Boost.ink</a> is basically some shitty url shortening tool which allows you to add stuff like 'Like this video and subscribe to this guy to access your file/url' for noname youtubers to gain more attention.<br>

On Twitter they claimed to have some 'unbypassable' system<br>

'A bypass is when you have an extension which directly puts you to the target URL without you having to do anything on our website.'

Well, so here it is.
A simple tampermonkey user script.
To have it auto redirect, uncomment line 80.
